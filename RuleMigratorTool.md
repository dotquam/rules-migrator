As a group focused on supporting Gnip customers, we are avid 'in-house' users of real-time PowerTrack. As developer advocates we work directly with Twitter data and often [write data stories](https://blog.gnip.com/tweeting-rain-part-4-tweets-2013-colorado-flood/). As a result we have curated many sets of operators in support for a wide variety of use-cases. 

So we started to develop a tool that could help us translate and migrate PowerTrack 1.0 rules to version 2.0. The result of that effort is available [HERE](https://github.com/jimmoffitt/rules-migrator) on GitHub. The project's README describes how the tool works and the type of 1.0 â†’ 2.0 rule translations it handles. Note that this tool can also be used to, for example, migrate rules between same-version streams, and from real-time to Replay streams.  

This tool is very much a prototype and continues to evolve as we approach the official launch of PowerTrack 2.0.
